# Acknowledgment

First of all, I am sincerely grateful for [Alfonso Garcia-Caro](https://twitter.com/alfonsogcnunez), the author and mastermind of the Fable compiler himself. Not only did he build such an awesome tool, he also was very kind, helped me get involved with the F# community and personally invited me to speak for FableConf. I have had a blast ever since and still enjoying my time writing F# and working with people from the community.

I want to thank the people who were kind to accept my request to review parts of the book, think with me about the material and suggest all kinds of improvements, as well as the hundreds of typos across the book. Thanks a lot to [Maxime Mangel](https://twitter.com/MangelMaxime), [Roman Sachse](https://twitter.com/R0MMSEN), [Tomasz Heimowski](https://twitter.com/theimowski) and [Julien Roncaglia](https://twitter.com/virtualblackfox).

Roman and I even streamed videos on Fable and Elmish on YouTube where we covered material that was loosely based on material from chapter one and two. Make sure to check these out on Roman's channel [The Dev Owl](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOX5DkLyqctM-wkOAU_mUpA) and subscribe for more as we try to stream whenever time permits.
